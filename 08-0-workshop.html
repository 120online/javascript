				<h1>In-class workshop</h1>
				<p>
					We’ve been running nearly non-stop for half a semester. 
					Today’s a workshop day.
					I’ll discuss the homework first, then 
					we’ll chat about Helvetica.
					Then everyone can display their project’s present state
					on their laptop screens.
					A little walk-around, some general comments...
					And then it’s ad-hoc, Q&amp;A, or what have you.
					I’m at your service.
				</p>
