				<h1>Introducing Three.js</h1>
				<p>
					<a target="_blank" href="http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js">Three.js</a> is an open-source 
					3D library for JavaScript that supports 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element">Canvas</a>, 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>, and 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">WebGL</a> renderers.  
					What does that mean?
					You can create interactive 3D animations right in the browser.
					Three’s homepage is at <a target="_blank" href="http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js">http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js</a>
					which includes examples, documentation, and a link to the 
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">Three.js GitHub repository</a>
					where you can always download the latest package.
				</p>
				<p>
					Three was created by Ricardo Cabello (aka. “Mr Doob”).
					His nickname has nothing to do with illegal substances. 
					Doob frequently codes with big headphones on in order to block out everything and focus on the task at hand.
					The word-shape of the lowercase <strong>doob</strong> is 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art">ASCII art</a> depicting Cabello’s eyes peering out between big headphone cans.

				<h2>An overly simple Three.js template</h2>
				<p>
					To ease the transition from squares to cubes I’ve made this very simple <a href="packages/threeTemplate.zip">threeTemplate.zip</a>.
					Here’s what you’ll find inside:
				</p>
				<br />
				<a href="packages/threeTemplate.zip"><img class="block" src="media/threeTemplate.jpg" /></a>
				<p>
					Drop the <code class="inline">index.html</code> file into your web browser.
					If you receive an error, or don't see any cube appear this means your browser or hardware does not support WebGL rendering. 
					Try using Chrome or Firefox instead. 
					(If you prefer Opera or Safari some quick searching online will yield instructions for enabling WebGL.)
				</p>
								
								
				<h2>Read the comments</h2>
				<p>
					Open the <code class="inline">scripts/application.js</code>
					in your text editor. 
					You will see that this source code is heavily commented.
					This is for your benefit.
					Have a look through the comments.
					What makes sense to you so far?
					What questions would you like to ask?
				</p>
				
				
				<h2>Getting physical</h2>
				<p>
					We’re not going to play with physics engines but if that’s something you want to tackle on your own time
					Mr. Doob recommends <a target="_blank" href="http://schteppe.github.com/cannon.js/">cannon.js</a>.
					Cannon was lovingly hand-crafted in JavaScripted rather than simply machine-transcoded from an existing engine.
				</p>


				<h2>Diving deeper</h2>
				<p>
					You’ve already played with the template via your “sneak peek” homework assignment.
					Let’s take a look at those on screen and start to take apart what the template is doing.
					We need to look inside the <code class="inline">addCube()</code> function and start
					looking at geometry, materials, and more.
					Let’s go!
