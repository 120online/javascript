				<h1>Homework</h1>
				<p>
					Today we discussed JSON, Twitter, and Google Maps.
					You now have a code template, <a href="packages/twitterEarth.zip">twitterEarth.zip</a>, for plotting tweets on the Earth.
					Your assignment: 
					Modify this template code to change the presentation style.
					
					What color are the pins? 
					Should their appearance be animated?
					Their disappearance? 
					Should they disappear?
					Would you rather have dots that bounce from one tweet to another?
					As beautiful as the Earth is, should that texture really be a photographic one?
					Should it have political borders?
					Or something else? Or nothing at all?
					(Do you really need a clouds layer?)
					Don’t forget that you can download many sorts of spherical textures from 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://www.celestiamotherlode.net/">The Celestia Motherlode</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now that you have a template to work from
					<strong>there’s no need to send me files on Thursday</strong>.
					Instead we’ll take a quick look in class on Friday as a group.
					Don’t worry about displaying the contents of the tweet yet
					(unless you really want to).
					We’ll discuss text in Three.js, as well as typography, in our next class together.
					I’ll also assign a more focussed goal for your template modifications when we meet,
					so experiment now. Experiment wildly. 
				</p>
				
				
				<h2>A reminder for some of you</h2>
				<p>
					A few of you still haven’t given me two Paper.js animations for the
					<a target="_blank" href="galleries/paperSquares/index.html">Paper Squares</a> gallery.
					(Please don’t fail my course!)
					It’s time for me to submit midterm grades and raise flags for any students who are falling behind.
					Deliver your animations to me before our next class so I can avoid giving you a temporary failing grade.
				</p>
