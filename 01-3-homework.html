				<h1>Homework</h1>
				<p>
					In next week’s class we’ll investigate JavaScript’s variable scoping and the magic of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)">closures</a>.
					We’ll also look at classical inheritance (traditional object-oriented inheritance involving classes) versus JavaScript’s 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming">prototypal inheritance</a>. 
					After we chat more about graphic design
					I’ll introduce you to the <a target="_blank" href="http://paperjs.org">Paper.js</a> framework and you’ll begin building some interactive animations on your own. 
					Your homework for this week has four components to be completed prior to our next class:
				</p>
				<br />
				
				
				<h2>1. Laptop, text editor, browser</h2>
				<p>
					Make sure for all subsequent classes you arrive with a laptop 
					(or some mobile machine you can use for our class purposes);
					a text editor such as <a target="_blank" href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> (Macintosh),
					<a target="_blank" href="http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/">TextWrangler</a> (Macintosh),
					or <a target="_blank" href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> (Windows);
					a browser such as 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>, 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://apple.com/safari">Safari</a>, 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://opera.com/download">Opera</a>, or
					<a target="_blank" href="http://mozilla.org">Firefox</a>
					that allows you access to the JavaScript console.
				</p>				
				
				
				<h2>2. Developing your code style</h2>
				<p>
					Read the short essay <a target="_blank" href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2010/05/semicolons/">Semicolons are Optional</a>
					and also browse the <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/a/khanacademy.org/forge/for-developers/styleguide/javascript">Kahn Academy JavaScript Styleguide</a>.
					We’ll discuss these very briefly next class.
					For your own personal contemplation: 
					What’s your own JavaScript coding style like?
					Where do you agree with and where do you differ from the status quo?
					(It’s ok to disagree.)
					But always bear in mind, 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node3.html">programs should be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute</a>.
				</p>
				
				
				<h2>3. And then there was JavaScript</h2>
				<p>
					Watch Douglas Crockford’s lecture <a target="_blank" href="http://yuiblog.com/crockford/">Chapter 2: And then there was JavaScript.</a>
					It’s an hour and a half so plan accordingly; break it up into chunks if necessary. 
					If possible, watch it with classmates as a group—informal discussion will help you better digest and retain Crockford’s valuable insights.

				</p>
				
				
				<h2>4. Square variations</h2>
				<p>
					Visual communication exercises often benefit from constraints, 
					forcing one to solve a problem through cleverness, subtlety, or both.
					For this first design assignment you will not use a computer, 
					but create your solutions by hand with construction paper, scissors, and glue.
					Contrary to the tools this is not a child’s task 
					but an opportunity for you to prove your ability to communicate in something akin to raw bits.
				</p>
				<p>
					For next class you will construct eight square posters, measuring 8 inches &times; 8 inches each,
					cut from black construction paper.
					On each poster you will affix four white squares measuring 1 inch &times; 1 inch each. 
					Your eight posters will express the following eight qualities, one quality per poster:
					1. Fortunate, 2. unfortunate, 3. robust, 4. fragile, 5. included, 6. excluded, 7. order, 8. chaos.
					There are no correct answers, but neatness counts.
				</p>
				<p>
					We’ll pin these up and/or lay them out on the tables during our next class and briefly discuss your approaches.
					Be sure to write your name on the back of each in case there’s confusion in the sea of 128 or so posters.
				</p>
