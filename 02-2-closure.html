				<h1>Closures</h1>
				<p>
					Functions are amazing in JavaScript.
					You may need to repeat that to yourself several times before it begins to sink in.
					We’re going to take a look at a few interesting aspects of functions,
					particularly a function’s ability to peek back at its parent’s variable scope even when the parent seems to no longer exist!
					(ie. The parent function has already executed and returned a value.)
					And that will bring us some <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)">closure</a>.
					<!-- JavaScript has <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scoping_and_dynamic_scoping">lexical scope</a -->
				</p>



				<h2>Function-scope, not block-scope</h2>
				<p>
					In JavaScript variables declared anywhere in a function exist <em>everywhere</em> within that function.
					(Consider the global object as one big container function for everything inside.
					In this way all of your code is always wrapped in at least one function.)
					If you’re coming from a language like Java or C++ it may seem odd that the following example exits after listing just ten numbers, rather than one hundred.
				</p>
<code>for( var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i ++ ){
	for( var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i ++ ){
		console.log( i )
	}
}</code>
				<p>
					In Java those would be two completely separate <code class="inline">i</code> variables, each existing in their own block scope—a
					boundary delimited by brackets.
					The interior <code class="inline">i</code>’s scope wouldn’t exist beyond the inner loop and therefore it would never conflict with the outer <code class="inline">i</code>. 
					But because JavaScript has function-wide scope what’s happening is when the inner <code class="inline">i</code> completes its loop
					that value of 10 is still present as the outer <code class="inline">i</code> checks its <code class="inline">for</code> condition of <code class="inline">i &lt; 10</code>.
					(Also worth noting: declaring a variable with <code class="inline">var</code> multiple times doesn’t throw an error so this will fail completely silently.)
					For comparison here it is again, this time with separate variables:
				</p>
<code>for( var y = 0; y &lt; 10; y ++ ){
	for( var x = 0; x &lt; 10; x ++ ){
		console.log( x )
	}
}</code>
				<p>
					A function always has access to its container:
				</p>
<code>var luckyNo = 7,
makeLuckier = function(){ luckyNo = 999 }
<span class="response">undefined</span>
luckyNo
<span class="response">7</span>
makeLuckier()
<span class="response">undefined</span>
luckyNo
<span class="response">999</span></code>
				<p>
					But the container doesn’t have access to variables declared inside.
					The child can inspect the parent, but the parent cannot inspect the child.
					Note that the only difference below is the <code class="inline">var</code> keyword inside the 
					<code class="inline">makeItLuckier</code> function, but it definitely changes the result.
				</p>
<code>var luckyNo = 7,
makeLuckier = function(){ var luckyNo = 999 }
<span class="response">undefined</span>
luckyNo
<span class="response">7</span>
makeLuckier()
<span class="response">undefined</span>
luckyNo
<span class="response">7</span></code>
				<!-- p>
					The code below has the same result because passing in an argument is equal to declaring it within the function itself.
				</p>
<code>var luckyNo = 7,
makeLuckier = function( luckyNo ){ luckyNo = 999 }
<span class="response">undefined</span>
luckyNo
<span class="response">7</span>
makeLuckier( luckyNo )
<span class="response">undefined</span>
luckyNo
<span class="response">7</span></code -->


				<hr />
				<h1>Lambdas</h1>
				<p>
					Remember how we can assign a value to a variable?
					Don’t worry, this isn’t a trick question:
				</p>
<code>luckyNumber = 7
<span class="response">7</span></code>
				<p>
					Ok. Well, what if we just get rid of the variable part? 
					When you enter a number into the console, you don’t have to assign it to a variable name.
					You can just enter the “number literal” <em>(ie. literally the number itself)</em>
					and JavaScript will echo that back to you:
				</p>
<code>7
<span class="response">7</span></code>
				<p>
					And of course you can do the same with strings by entering a “string literal” <em>(ie. literally the string itself)</em>.
				</p>
<code>'seven'
<span class="response">"seven"</span></code> 
				<p>
					That’s sort of interesting but doesn’t feel all that useful. 
					I mean, what good is a raw value that you can’t recall and do operations on later?
					Well, the brain bending part is that in addition to entering number literals or string literals you can enter <em>function literals</em> too.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unnamed functions are often called <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function">anonymous functions</a>
					or <em>lambdas</em>, as their conceptual structure was first borrowed from <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a> for the 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp programming language</a>.
					The über sexy mathematical symbol for lambda is λ.
					I won’t make you memorize all of that or force you to read up on how inspirational 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a> and 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)">John McCarthy</a> were.
					Just remember that <em>lambda</em> means <em>a function without a name.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					So what does a function without a name look like?
				</p>
<code>(function(){ return 'Hello, World!' })
<span class="response">function(){ return 'Hello, World!' }</span></code>
				<p>
					Well, it looks like a regular function, but without an assigned name, and it’s wrapped in parenthesis. 
					We’ve declared an anonymous function but it’s like junk DNA—the code inside can never be executed. 
					Or can it be?
				</p>
				<br />

				<h2>IIFE’s</h2>
				<p>
					But here’s the big deal:
					We can immediately invoke a lambda function, causing it to execute as soon as it is declared,
					just by placing invocation parenthesis at the end of the function expression like this:
				</p>
<code>(function(){ return 'Hello, World!' })()
<span class="response">"Hello, World!"</span></code>
				<p>
					Look at that! We simultaneously create the function and execute it, 
					causing the console to echo back <code class="inline">"Hello, World!"</code>
					We’ll follow <a target="_blank" href="http://benalman.com">Ben Alman</a>’s lead and call these strange creatures
					Immediately Invoked Function Expressions, or IIFE’s for short.
					(Pronounced like <em>iffy</em>.)
					You could assign this IIFE to a variable and it would almost look like 
					a normal function declaration. 
					But keep in mind you’d be setting the variable equal to the function’s return value,
					not equal to the function itself:
				</p>
<code>var hello = (function(){ return 'Hello, World!' })()
<span class="response">undefined</span>
hello
<span class="response">"Hello, World!"</span>
hello === (function(){ return 'Hello, World!' })
<span class="response">false</span>
hello === (function(){ return 'Hello, World!' })()
<span class="response">true</span></code>
				
				
				
				
				<h2>Expression vs. declaration</h2>
				<p>
					So far in class I’ve insisted on creating functions and assigning them to variables (the expression form):
					<code>var hello = function(){}</code>
					rather than the classical definition form:
					<code>function hello(){}</code>
					This is because I’ve wanted to drive home the point that in JavaScript functions are first-class variables.
					You can store them in objects, in arrays, pass them as arguments to other functions, and so on—just like you would with a number or string.
				</p>
				<p>
					The two forms above are nearly equal but it’s worth explaining the difference as we dig deeper into JavaScript.
					In the first example what we’re actually doing is creating an anonymous function and after creation it’s being assigned to the <code class="inline">hello</code> variable.
					In the second example we’re defining a named, rather than anonymous, function. 
					We can actually combine the two methods:
				</p>
<code>var bat = function man(){
	if( man.caller === man ){
		console.log( 'And this second.' )
		return
	}
	console.log( 'This will fire first.' )
	man()
}
<span class="response">undefined</span>
man()
<span class="response">► ReferenceError: man is not defined</span>
bat()
<span class="response">This will fire first.
And this second.</span></code>
				<p>
					So what’s happening here? Does anyone have any guesses? 
					Show of hands? 
					If you’re not brave enough to risk an answer you’ll just have to wait for the brief video lecture below.
				</p>

				
				<hr />
				<h1>Closure and private variables</h1>
				<p>
					We keep hinting at closure, coming at it from different angles. 
					Closure is the ability of an inner function to close over—or trap—references to its containing function.
					In JavaScript if you have a reference to a variable then you are allowed to read its value and assign new values to it.
					Closures allow you to hide these references, restricting who has access to what.
					Let’s illustrate that through private variables.
				</p>
<code>var magician = (function(){
	var 
	inHand   = 'nothing',
	inPocket = 'ace of spades',
	swap     =  function(){
		var temp    = this.inHand
		this.inHand = inPocket
		inPocket    = temp
	}
	return { inHand: inHand, swap: swap }
})()
<span class="response">undefined</span>
magician
<span class="response">► Object</span></code>
				<p>
					Be sure to copy and paste the above code into the console.
					Inspect the resulting object.
					(Why it is an object and not a function?) 
					You can see that its keys and values mirror what our IIFE is returning:
					<code class="inline">inHand</code> and <code class="inline">swap()</code>.
					What doesn’t it have?
					There’s no way to know what the current value of <code class="inline">inPocket</code> is.
					Oh wait... Well I suppose if you’re simply swapping 
					<code class="inline">inHand</code> and
					<code class="inline">inPocket</code>
					and you have access to <code class="inline">inHand</code>,
					then it’s pretty easy to guess the value of <code class="inline">inPocket</code>.
					So let’s push this example just one step further: 
				</p>
<code>var magician = (function(){
	var 
	inHand   = 'nothing',
	inPocket =  Math.random(),
	swap     =  function(){
		this.inHand = inPocket
		inPocket    = Math.random()
	}
	return { inHand: inHand, swap: swap }
})()</code>
				<p>
					Now <code class="inline">inPocket</code> is a random number and you have no way of guessing what it is.
					Each time you call <code class="inline">swap()</code> a new random number is loaded into <code class="inline">inPocket</code>.
					Note that JavaScript’s <code class="inline">Math.random()</code> function returns a float value between zero and one.
					Next week when we discuss <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming">prototypal inheritance</a>
					I’ll introduce you to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stewdio/skip">Skip.js</a> 
					and its convenience functions such as <code class="inline">Number.rand()</code> which returns random integers within a range.
					We’ll also really tackle the <code class="inline">this</code> keyword—it’s where closure meets inheritance. 
					For now think of it as the “owner” of the function. 
					If you’re curious try experimenting with it a bit in the console ;)
				</p>

			
				<h2>A timely example</h2>
				<p>
					JavaScript has a really useful built-in method called 
					<code class="inline"><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.setTimeout">setTimeout</a></code>
					that waits for a specified number of milliseconds, then fires a callback function.
					(See also its cousin <code class="inline"><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.setInterval">setInterval</a></code>.)
					Here’s a simple example that waits for 2000 milliseconds (equal to two whole seconds)
					and then fires the callback function we provide:
				</p>
<code>setTimeout( function(){
	alert( 'Two seconds later...' )
}, 2000 )</code>	
				<p>
					Here’s a problem though: Look at the code sample below. 
					Because of closure our callback function will still have “live access” to the value of <code class="inline">i</code> when it finally fires.
					Who can tell me what’s going to happen here?
					Try it yourself: copy and paste the example into your console.
					Why does this error change the value being displayed but not the timing of <code class="inline">setTimeout</code>?
				</p>
<code>for( var i = 1; i &lt;= 5; i ++ ){	
	window.setTimeout( function(){
		alert( i + ' out of 5' )
	}, 1000 * i )
}</code>
				<p>
					What’s the difference between the code above and the code below?
					How does the code below solve the problem encountered above?
				</p>
<code>for( var i = 1; i &lt;= 5; i ++ ){
	(function( i ){
		window.setTimeout( function(){
			alert( i + ' out of 5' )
		}, 1000 * i )
	})( i )
}</code>
				<p>
					This can be tricky stuff at first. 
					The best way to better understand closure (and JavaScript’s <a target="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scoping_and_dynamic_scoping">lexical scoping</a>)
					is to just keep playing with it. 
					The more you experiment the more you will develop and intuitive sense of scope and how to make it work for you.
