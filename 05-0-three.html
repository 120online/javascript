				<h1>Powers of Three</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>Friday, 5 October 2012</strong>.
					As I said in the homework last week, up until now you’ve been working in two dimensions.
					It’s time to add a third. 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js">Three.js</a> will take us from squares to cubes in no time.
					But first, let’s finally have that discussion about 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming">prototypal inheritance</a>.
					Then we’ll take a break. 
					When we come back we’ll have a brief look around at your homework
					(so have it ready to go on your screens)
					and we’ll start diving deeper into what Three is and what it can do.
					So don’t be afraid to ask questions.
				</p>
