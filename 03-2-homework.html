				<h1>Homework</h1>
				<p>
					Let’s focus this week.
					It’s all about getting your two one-minute Paper animations just right and creating a poster frame for each.
					And remember these are <strong>due 24 hours before class</strong>
					so that I can assemble a simple gallery of all your creations for a group critique next Friday.
					I will endeavor to bring some guests.
				</p>


				<h2>1. Finish your Paperwork</h2>
				<p>
					It’s time to standardize sizes for your animations:
					600 &times; 600 pixels.					
					Change your document title in the HTML,
					I don’t want to see anymore assignments titled “Paper template.”
					(If you’re not familiar with HTML it’s easy—I’ll show you how.)
				</p>
				<p>
					Be certain that your animation is exactly one minute
					and include a gray (<code class="inline">0x222222</code>) end frame
					so that your animation area will match the background color of the HTML document.
					(If you prefer to edit the stylesheet so that the canvas is transparent 
					and draw your own black background in Paper that’s also fine.)
					I noticed some of you had set your square’s selection states to “selected”
					which is fantastic for debugging, but be sure to remove this before submitting your work.
				</p>
				<p>
					I’m allowing you to use color for your squares now.
					Be careful.
					You now have great power. Use it wisely.
					When is less color more color?
					Contrast can only exist in the presence of restraint.
					Continue to use a black background.
					(If you prefer to keep your squares white that is of course fine.)
				</p>
				<p>
					When you send me your work, this time ZIP everything up rather than just sending the HTML file.
					In your email to me please include your full name and the titles of your pieces.
					(This will make it easier for me to integrate them into a gallery site.)
				</p>
				<p>
					For your own thoughts: 
					How does the final product here compare to the construction paper posters you made?
					Is there a sense of continuity, or did the change in medium cause you to invent anew?
				</p>


				<h2>2. Poster frame<h1>
				<p>
					Create a 600 &times; 600 pixel JPEG poster frame for each of your two animations.
					How will you represent your animations?
					(It’s not easy to legibly distill time into one frame.)
					Does your poster frame represent the first frame of your animation—leaving the punchline a surprise?
					Or is the finale the best representation?
					Somewhere in between? All frames overlaid?
				</p>
				<p>
					The tools you use for this are up to you—screen grabs, Illustrator drawings, etc. 
					so long as the deliverable is a 600 &times; 600 pixel JPEG that is “true to your animation.”
				</p>
