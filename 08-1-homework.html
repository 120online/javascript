				<h1>Homework</h1>
				<p>
					Here it is, your moment of <strike>zen</strike> <em>homework</em>.
				</p>


				<h2>1. Finish it up</h2>
				<p>
					It’s time to wrap up your Twitter globes. 
					You already have a word or phrase which can act as your Twitter search term,
					your project’s title, and of course your project’s overall theme.
					Now how does your project visually express this theme?
					What does the earth look like?
					What does the text look like?
					What’s the content of that text?
					(Is it the text from the tweets you’ve found?
					Is it the text from the tweets <em>minus</em> the word or phrase you’ve searched for?)
					How do elements appear, move, and disappear from view?
					What were the informal comments you received in class today?
				</p>


				<h2>2. Make a poster JPEG</h2>
				<p>
					Just like your Paper Squares project I’ll need a 600 &times; 600 pixel poster frame. 
					(This will act as your project’s icon in the gallery.)
					It can be a screen grab or a “visual summary” of your project.
					I will leave what that means up to you.
				</p>


				<h2>3. Send it on Thursday</h2>
				<p>
					Email me your code and poster JPEG by next Thursday night 
					so that I can package it in a new gallery.
					Next week I will attempt to have one or more guest critics in
					as an audience and we will have a look at all of your projects.
					Remember that time will be short so that we can accommodate each of you.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						Do you have a backup plan if the Internet connection goes down
						or if Twitter’s API stops responding?
					</strong>
					(Like loading canned data from your <code class="inline">database.js</code> file.)
					Being prepared for catastrophe is always a smart move.
				</p>
