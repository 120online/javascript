				<h1>Welcome</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>Friday, 7 September 2012</strong>.
					Let’s jump right in.
					Our first two classes together will be rather lecture-heavy with occasional video content.
					Your individual JavaScript skill levels and experience are varied.
					Covering the basics will bring newcomers up to speed and 
					perhaps add a new angle of perspective to those of you already familiar with the language.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the course progresses we’ll transition into more of a workshop, 
					with an emphasis on exploration and creation.
					I’ll occasionally invite guest critics in to review your work and answer your questions.
				</p>
