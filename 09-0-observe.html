				<h1>Observe and report</h1>
				<p>
					Wow. A hurriance. A nor’easter. A presidential election.
					Welcome back after a very unexpected week off.
					We’re going to push back our Twitter globe critique another week
					so that you have additional time to regroup mentally,
					to ask more questions, and to get more answers.
					Meanwhile we’re going to cover some new material here in class.
					Compared to learning Three.js and fetching live data
					this is easy stuff.
					We’re going to play with the webcam and its video feed.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a bonus we’ll take a quick look at jQuery together—as per several students’ request.
					(Just the basics.)
				</p
