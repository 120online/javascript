				<h1>Code is data</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>Friday, 12 October 2012</strong>.
					JavaScript has a data format that it can load, parse, search, and modify.
					This data format is called JavaScript.
					(What?!)
					Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is the basis of JSON, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JavaScript Object Notation</a>.
					We’ll take a brief look at the JSON specification
					and how JavaScript can use itself to store and sort data.
					(And then we’ll find some actual JavaScript data to store and sort.)
					Then it’s break time.
				</p>
				<p>
					After the break we’ll look over your homework and see if we can combine this idea of 
					fetching and sorting data with that fancy Earth template you’ve got in your hands.
				</p>
