				<h1>Visualizing JavaScript</h1>
				<p>
					This is an <a target="_blank" href="https://itp.nyu.edu/registration/CourseListing.php?year=2012&semester=Fall">Autumn 2012</a> course for second-year graduate students in New&nbsp;York University’s <a target="blank" href="http://itp.nyu.edu">Interactive Telecommunications Program</a>;
					taught by me, <a target="_blank" href="http://stewd.io">Stewart Smith</a>, on Fridays, between 15:30 and 18:00 at
					<a target="_blanl" href="http://itp.nyu.edu/sigs/program/directions/">721 Broadway (4th Floor) New York NY 10003</a>
					in Room 406; 
					course registration call number <a target="_blank" href="https://itp.nyu.edu/registration/CourseInfo.php?course_id=573">17155</a>.
					Students are expected to be proficient programmers, 
					though JavaScript familiarity is not a prerequisite—nor is graphic design experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					ITP courses are graded as pass/fail.
					Auditing is not permitted and the class size will not be augmented to accommodate those wait-listed.
					Regular attendance, participation in class discussion, and satisfactory completion of assignments is expected.
				</p>


				<h2>What’s the content?</h2>
				<p>
					Visualizing JavaScript is half coding (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, of course),
					half graphic design (visual communication), and the marriage of the two.
					Course content will be revealed on <a href="http://stewd.io/javascript">stewd.io/javascript</a> as the class advances.
					This site itself is available on GitHub (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stewdio/javascript">github.com/stewdio/javascript</a>)
					for download and comment.
					
				</p>

				<h2>Office hours and contact</h2>
				<p>
					I don’t have set office hours but I do make time for each of you as needed. 
					If you have any questions, or even just a sinking uncertain feeling about our class discussions, these course notes, or your homework assignments
					don’t hesitate to send me an <a href="#" onclick="A.email(this)" host="stewd.io" user="stewart">email</a> 
					or ping me on <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/stewd_io">Twitter (@stewd_io)</a>.
					Monday through Thursday I’m at Google Creative Lab so have patience, but do expect a response.
				</p>
